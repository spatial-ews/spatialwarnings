Description: Tools to compute and assess significance of early-warnings signals (EWS) of ecosystem degradation. EWS are spatial metrics derived from raster data -- e.g. spatial autocorrelation -- that increase before an ecosystem undergoes a non-linear transition (Genin et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13058>).
